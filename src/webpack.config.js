/*
  Externals is webpack's way to keep certain dependencies
  out of the compilation/chunking flow,
  and instead tell compiled code that they will be
  globally available in runtime from other Ã­mported libraries, say from a CDN.

  This webpack file wraps the building those external libraries from existing packages.
  They are built into one separate chunk (TODO for later: multiple chunks?),
  along with some features tailored for React4xp:
  it gives the produced chunk a contenthash in the filename, and outputs a JSON file with the
  hashed name, for runtime reference. Content-hashed for caching and cache-busting.

  Which dependencies are inserted into the external library,
  depends on an `env.EXTERNALS` parameter (EXTERNALS can also be supplied through a
  JSON config file referenced with an `env.REACT4XP_CONFIG_FILE` - see for example
  [react4xp-buildconstants](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-buildconstants), although you can roll your own).
  This `EXTERNALS` parameter must be an object on the webpack
  externals format `{ "libraryname": "ReferenceInCode", ... }`,
  e.g. `{ "react-dom": "ReactDOM" }`. These libraries of course have to be supplied
  from the calling context (as such, they can be thought of
  as peer dependencies, but are obviously impossible to declare).
  `EXTERNALS` can also be a valid JSON-format string.

  In the same way, one more parameter is expected either directly through `env`
  or in the JSON file referenced through `env.REACT4XP_CONFIG_FILE`:
  - `BUILD_R4X`: mandatory string, full path to the
  React4xp build folder (where all react4xp-specific output files will be built)
